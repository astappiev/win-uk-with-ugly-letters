## Layout
The keyboard layout is an original Ukrainian layout, however, when you need access to the letters you see above you can press AltGr + the letter's location.

E.g. (you can also use Shift+AltGr+letter):
```
AltGr + і = Ы
AltGr + е = Ё
AltGr + є = Э
AltGr + ь = Ъ
```

## How to Build or Install
You can download the latest installer from the [releases tab of this repo](https://github.com/astappiev/win-uk-with-ugly-letters/releases).
